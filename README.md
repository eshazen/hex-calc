# hex-calc

Hex/Binary/Decimal calculator inspired by HP-16C

This would be a rather simple calculator supporting
easy hex/decimal/binary conversions with 8/16/32/64 bit word size.
I'd like it to be portable/battery powered, so likely a simple
character LCD display.

See https://github.com/eshazen/calc-demo-xwin for an X-windows
app written in C which illustrates the general idea.

Since the main point is something functional, it would use
a modern micrcocontroller with good C support.
